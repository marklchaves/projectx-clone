# ProjectX

Projectx is a space for artists, photographers, architects, designers etc, which will hopefully be the antithesis of the social media platforms. No likes, no followers, not having constantly produce content to help drive their money making machine forward and being punished by algorithms if you donâ€™t obey! 

So instead of constantly uploading streams of work, every hour - every day, there will be a 20 minute window, once a week to upload work (hence timer). To be selected then published on our website.
