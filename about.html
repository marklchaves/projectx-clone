  <p>Projectx is a space for artists, photographers, architects, designers etc, which will hopefully be the antithesis of the social media platforms. No likes, no followers, not having constantly produce content to help drive their money making machine forward and being punished by algorithms if you don’t obey!</p>

  <p>So instead of constantly uploading streams of work, every hour - every day, there will be a 20 minute window, once a week to upload work (hence timer). To be selected then published on our website.</p>

  "I don't think about making art, just get it done. let everyone else decide if it's good or bad, whether they love it or hate it. while they are deciding, make even more art." ~Andy Warhol
