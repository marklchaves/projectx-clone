## Introduction

The theme that ProjectX was built on (Barber) used **Formcarry** by default for the contact form (popup modal). **Formcarry** allows only one free form. So, we decided to use **Formspree** instead (staying with the minimalist theme). **JotForm** is a nice contender but a _heavier_ solution (uses iFrames) and overkill at this time).

**Formspree's** free plan offers unlimited free forms up to 50 submissions/month.

**Formcarry** is a temporary solution. We still have it because it will take a bit of time redoing the theme to use something else for the contact form. Therefore, the **Formspree** account is under my name. Again, this _should_ be temporary.
