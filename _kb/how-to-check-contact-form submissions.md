## Introduction

The theme that ProjectX was built on (Barber) used **Formcarry** by default for the contact form (popup modal). **Formcarry** allows only one free form. So, we decided to use **Formspree** instead (keeping with the minimalist motif). **JotForm** is a nice contender but a _heavier_ solution. JotForm uses iFrames, and it comes with many features we don't need at this time. We'd like to keep this site as light as possible.

**Formspree's** free plan offers unlimited free forms up to 50 submissions/month. So, **Formspree** will be our long-term forms solution.

**Formcarry** is a temporary solution. We haven't changed it yet because the work is a bit out-of-scope at this time. Therefore, the **Formspree** account is under my name. Again, this _should_ be temporary.
