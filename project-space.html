    <p>‘Ghost Estates’ is an unfinished project; my intention was to contextualise and archive these unfinished homes –
      and in some cases, entire housing developments that had been abandoned mid build due to the 2008 recession (UK).In
      2008 the UK housing market crashed leaving many developers little choice but to down tools. The Housing Executive
      released a report in August 2011 estimating that there were up to 5000 unfinished homes in Northern Ireland.</p>

      locked
      into mortgages for houses they would never see."
    </blockquote>

    <p>In 2012 some of these developments still lay vacant, they had succumbed to the elements, vandalism and the
      apparent
      theft of materials. The photographs were taken in Coalisland, Co. Tyrone, Northern Ireland over a 2-year period
      between 2012-2014.</p>

    <p>I have always had an interest in our surroundings, how we interact with our environment both built and natural.
      These photographs, to me at least, portrayed the relationship between essential architecture, greed culture that
      contributed to the economic collapse and the dashed hopes of those trapped in an equity blackhole. There is a
      certain poignancy to these images – they comment on the ‘Boom’ years, yes, but they also represent the aftermath,
      those people that were locked into mortgages for houses they would never see. </p>

    <p>I had always intended to continue this work, but I got caught in other things and forgot about it until recently
      when looking through old projects. I have since re-examined the project again and thought of revisiting the sites,
      however, I honestly do not know if it would work. The two locations I had previously photographed have been
      finished
      or torn down and rebuilt. Is it worth photographing them finally completed nearly a decade on? Is it worth
      resurrecting this project? Maybe not resurrecting it but using it as a springboard to respond to the works, to
      create something new. </p>

    <p>The narrative that drove this project is now old news, and it is a narrative that many artists have responded to.
      So, the question I am asking myself is what direction can I take this project that will present a fresh insight on
      these events, an insight that is relevant in 2021?</p>
